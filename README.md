# ðŸ§  CNN-Based Brain Tumor Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify MRI brain scans into tumor and non-tumor categories.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Brain tumors can be life-threatening and early detection is crucial. This project leverages deep learning to automate brain tumor detection from MRI images with high accuracy.

- **Accuracy**: Achieved ~88.6% training and ~82.4% validation accuracy (can be improved further)
- **Data**: MRI Brain Tumor Image Dataset (from Kaggle or local dataset)
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
